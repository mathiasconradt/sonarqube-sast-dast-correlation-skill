# SonarQube SAST-DAST Correlation Skill

> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL SKILL - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
>
> This is an experimental skill and repository. While it has been tested in development environments, it should be used with caution in production settings. The skill makes API calls to SonarQube and may modify issue tags and comments. Always review the actions before confirming, and test in a non-production environment first. The authors are not responsible for any unintended consequences or data loss.

A Claude Code skill that intelligently correlates Static Application Security Testing (SAST) findings from SonarQube with Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) findings from SARIF files (StackHawk, ZAP, etc.) to generate comprehensive security correlation reports.

## ⚠️ Quick Reference: Issue Tagging

When tagging correlated issues in SonarQube:
- **Tag**: Use ONLY `dast-detected` (no other tags!)
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removes ALL existing `dast-detected` tags and correlation comments before tagging
- **Comments**: Adds detailed correlation comment with severity icon, confidence, endpoint/parameter verification
- **Format**: `{icon} **DAST Correlation - {CONFIDENCE}**` (🔴=BLOCKER/CRITICAL, 🟠=MAJOR, 🟡=MINOR, 🔵=INFO)

See [Implementation Guide - Step 10](references/implementation-guide.md) for complete tagging workflow.

## Overview

Security testing often involves running both SAST and DAST tools independently, but manually correlating their findings is time-consuming and error-prone. This skill automates the correlation process using AI-powered analysis to:

- **Match vulnerabilities** detected by both SAST and DAST tools
- **Validate exploitability** by confirming code-level issues are runtime-exploitable
- **Prioritize fixes** by highlighting vulnerabilities confirmed by both testing methods
- **Generate detailed reports** with taint flow analysis and direct links to findings
- **Tag correlated issues** in SonarQube for team tracking

## Key Features

### 🔍 Intelligent Correlation Analysis

- **Vulnerability Type Matching**: Maps SAST rules (e.g., `javasecurity:S3649`) to DAST findings (e.g., `sql-injection`)
- **Endpoint/Component Mapping**: Traces Java controller classes to URI paths
- **Taint Flow Analysis**: Matches data flow from HTTP requests to vulnerable sinks
- **Confidence Scoring**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence levels based on multiple correlation factors

### 🎯 Supported Vulnerabilities

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Path Traversal
- XML External Entities (XXE)
- Command Injection
- And more...

### 📊 Comprehensive Reporting

   export SONAR_TOKEN="your-sonarqube-token"
   export SONARQUBE_URL="https://your-sonarqube-instance.com"
   export SONAR_PROJECT_KEY="your-project-key"
   ```

2. **`.sonarlint/connectedMode.json`** in your project:
   ```json
   {
     "sonarQubeUri": "https://your-sonarqube-instance.com",
     "projectKey": "your-project-key"
   }
   ```

3. **`sonar-project.properties`** in your project:
   ```properties
   sonar.host.url=https://your-sonarqube-instance.com
   sonar.token=your-sonarqube-token
   sonar.projectKey=your-project-key
   ```

If credentials are not found, the skill will prompt you to provide them.

## Example Report

```markdown
# SonarQube SAST-DAST Correlation Report

**Generated:** 2026-03-29
**Project:** my-awesome-app

## Executive Summary

- **SAST Tool:** SonarQube
- **DAST Tool:** StackHawk
- **Total SAST Issues:** 102
- **Total DAST Issues:** 49
- **✅ Correlated Issues:** 2 **HIGH CONFIDENCE**

## 🔥 Correlated Findings - HIGH PRIORITY

### 🚨 Correlation #1: SQL Injection

#### SAST Finding (Code Analysis)
- **File:** `SearchRepository.java:23`
- **Taint Flow:** HomeController.java:31 (user input) → SearchRepository.java:23 (SQL concatenation)
- 🔗 [View in SonarQube](...)

#### DAST Finding (Runtime Testing)
- **Endpoint:** `POST /`
- **Method:** POST
- 🔗 [View in StackHawk](...)

**Confidence Level:** high ✅
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection

- Fetches SAST issues from SonarQube API
- Filters out imported DAST issues (e.g., `external_StackHawk:*`)
- Parses DAST findings from SARIF files

### 2. AI-Powered Correlation

Uses Claude's general-purpose agent to:
- Match vulnerability types across tools
- Trace code paths from controllers to endpoints
- Analyze taint flows (source → sink)
- Score confidence based on multiple factors

### 3. Report Generation

Creates a comprehensive markdown report with:
- Correlated findings prioritized by confidence
- Detailed taint flow analysis
- Direct links to both SonarQube and DAST tools
- Coverage gap analysis
- Actionable remediation recommendations

### 4. SonarQube Tagging (Optional)

- Tags correlated issues with `dast-detected`
- Adds detailed correlation comments
- Links to DAST findings for easy reference

## Benefits

### 🎯 Focus on What Matters

Not all SAST findings are exploitable in practice. This skill identifies the 2-5% of SAST issues that are **confirmed exploitable** by DAST testing, allowing your team to prioritize high-confidence vulnerabilities.

### 📈 Understand Tool Coverage

See which vulnerability types are covered by SAST vs. DAST:
- **SAST excels**: Code-level issues (XXE, path traversal, command injection)
- **DAST excels**: Runtime issues (security headers, CSRF, session management)
- **Both detect**: SQL injection, XSS (when correlated = highest priority)

### ⚡ Save Time

Manual correlation of 100+ SAST and 40+ DAST findings can take hours. This skill completes the analysis in minutes with detailed reasoning for each correlation.

### 🔗 Seamless Integration

Works with your existing tools:
- SonarQube for SAST
- StackHawk, ZAP, or any SARIF-compliant DAST scanner
- Direct integration with SonarQube issue tagging

## Correlation Strategies

### Vulnerability Type Matching
- Maps SonarQube security rules to DAST CWE/vulnerability IDs
- Example: `javasecurity:S3649` ↔ `sql-injection`

### Endpoint/Component Mapping
- Traces Java controller classes to HTTP endpoints
- Example: `HomeController POST "/"` ↔ `POST / ` DAST finding

### Taint Flow Analysis
- Examines data flow from request parameters to vulnerable sinks
- Example: `@RequestParam` → SQL query → matches DAST SQL injection

### Confidence Scoring
- **HIGH**: Same vuln type + exact endpoint match + taint flow alignment
- **MEDIUM**: Same vuln type + partial component match
- **LOW**: Same vuln type only

## Use Cases

- **Security Teams**: Validate SAST findings with runtime exploitation proof
- **DevSecOps**: Prioritize vulnerability remediation based on confirmed exploitability
- **Compliance**: Demonstrate comprehensive security testing coverage
- **Development Teams**: Focus on fixing vulnerabilities that matter most

## Supported Languages

The correlation logic works with any language supported by SonarQube and your DAST tool. Taint flow analysis is optimized for:
- Java (Spring Boot, Spring MVC)
- Other languages supported with basic correlation

## Troubleshooting

### No Correlations Found

If the analysis produces no correlations:
- Ensure both SAST and DAST scanned the same application
- Verify SARIF file contains actual findings (not just info-level)
- Check that SAST issues are real security findings (not code quality issues)
- The Agent may need more specific instructions (skill will auto-retry if needed)

### SonarQube API Errors

- Verify `SONAR_TOKEN` has correct permissions
- Ensure `SONARQUBE_URL` is accessible from your machine
- Check `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` matches your project

### SARIF File Issues

- Ensure SARIF file follows the [SARIF 2.1.0 specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html)
- Validate with: `cat your-file.sarif | jq .`
